# matlab-code
This repository contains the single .m file needed to run ColTapp from MATLAB. Code is written and tested in R2020a but should probably run on older versions (some functions tested on R2016b) if all necesarry toolboxes are installed. Necessary toolboxes: Mapping Toolbox, Image Processing Toolbox, Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox and GUI Layout Toolbox.
